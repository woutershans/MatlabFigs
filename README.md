MATLAB figures from published peer-reviewed papers, in ".m" format.

The published papers can generally be found at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089569987
Pre-prints are generally publicly available at https://www.researchgate.net/profile/hans-wouters-5

The title of the MATLAB files should link to the name and year of the conference or journal of publication; partial list below:
* FiguresTPEL24.m    ->    https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265141
* FiguresAPEC24.m    ->    https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10509410

Figures are post-processed in Illustrator.

Please consider that this code is made public, but lots of time has typically gone into it.
It is shared for the common appreciation of nice graphs :)

Disclaimer: I try to document my code as good as possible, but many of these are made under deadlines.
